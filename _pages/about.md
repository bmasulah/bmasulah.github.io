Hi, I’m Bidayatul Masulah, though most people call me **Bida**.
I hold a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from **Leiden University**, with my thesis research carried out at **Utrecht University**. My academic work sits at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and biological systems, where I use mathematical models and simulations to study complex phenomena.

Research Interests
======
My research interests include:

- Mathematical and computational modeling
- Dynamical systems and differential equations
- Simulation of biological and complex systems
- Quantitative methods for interdisciplinary research

During my master’s thesis, I worked on computational models of cellular systems. This experience helped me move comfortably between mathematical formulation, simulation, and interpretation, while collaborating with researchers outside mathematics.

Teaching & Professional Experience
======
Alongside my academic work, I’m currently active in education:

1. SAT Mathematics Tutor at Kobi Education, teaching mathematical reasoning, problem-solving strategies, and efficient test-taking approaches.
2. IELTS Instructor at Schoters, focusing on academic English, structured writing, and exam strategies.

Academic Journey
------
I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at Universitas Airlangga, where I graduated as an Outstanding Graduate. My academic path began in a rather different setting—I grew up in a pesantren background, which shaped how I approach learning, discipline, and reflection.

Over time, mathematics became a space where structure and curiosity met. Studying and conducting research in international academic environments later taught me how to work independently, collaborate across disciplines, and communicate technical ideas with clarity. 

Beyond Academia
------
Outside academia, I enjoy traveling and cultural exploration. Before turning 30, I set a personal goal to visit 30 countries—not as a checklist, but as a way to learn from different places and perspectives. This habit of observing and listening has influenced how I think about both research and teaching.

On this site, I share a few moments from that journey, including my undergraduate graduation at Universitas Airlangga, which marked an important milestone in my academic life.


Looking Ahead
------
I am preparing for doctoral studies and a long-term academic career as a lecturer, with a focus on applied research and interdisciplinary work.
